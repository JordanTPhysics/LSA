                The Madrassah curriculum is designed to teach children the basics of Islam, including the Quran, Hadith, and Islamic History.
                The Madrassah also provides a platform for children to develop their social skills and build friendships with other children in the community.
                The Madrassah is open to all children, regardless of their background or religious affiliation.

                We welcome children from all faiths and backgrounds to join us in learning about Islam and the Quran.
